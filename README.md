### What is “WatchMarket”?
Markets is an aggregation and caching app for blockchain market information:

Aggregation: it standardizes information from different blockchain data providers e.g. Coinmarketcap into a unified format

Caching: it acts as a caching layer for this information mainly catering to the goal of cost savings as API calls to data providers are expensive
